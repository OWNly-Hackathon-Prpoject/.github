## Ideation

- What are you doing with your digital and social footprint? How much has blockchain benefitted you as you go along on your normal online social engagements? How about monetizing your digital footprints and other of your intellectual properties in the digital space?
- The OWNly project is an own and share NFT Copyright Platform. You can literally put a price on almost anything-U in the digital space. We categorise the digital space into two: the Social-U and the Non-Social-U. The Social-U comprise of post from all social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok etc. The Non-Social-U comprise of books, biography, video tutorials, whistleblower's account, blog, news, declassified and classified secrets etc. These digital items can be minted, shared and sold or even rented since they are intellectual digital footprints.
- The MVP for this HTM hackathon is the Social-U of Twitter NFT. Tweet owners can deploy their tweets and allow the general public, followers alike to mint their tweets. The usage of these NFTs are very important. We have two variants:
  - The Transferrable & the Non-transferrable. The transferrable are like the normal NFTs while the non-transferrable are specially designed for fundraising purposes. The NFT only serves as a receipt for participation in a fundraising that the deployer might have organized.

## UI
- The `Figma` design can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/PE6sPsfpy62nlqpMGz9gy6/Hackathon?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=0%3A158&viewport=727%2C429%2C0.23&scaling=scale-down&starting-point-node-id=0%3A12).
- The landing page below projects the entire cycle of the product line up while we focus on the Twitter version.
- The Launch App button loads the `tweet NFT` page. Here users can input a tweet url and proceed to either deploy or mint. (Only deployed tweets can be minted and only tweet owners can deploy). Deploy simply means alerting the blockchain  and giving it the permission to mint your tweets.

## Contracts

### Overview
Contract allows to mint ERC721 NFT with metadata from `NFT.storage` API. Content creator can easily deploy their valuable tweets with customizable fees and supply. Followers in order to support the creator can mint the NFT paying some fee (established by content creator). Users can use their personal balance in vault for paying for transactions without any signing of transaction. This abstraction allows for users to only send in some bulk amount to vault once in a while to prevent having to always sign transaction using a provider.

### Tests
The [integration test](https://github.com/OWNly-Hackathon-Prpoject/contracts/tree/main/test/integration) imitates well, how the general flow looks like:
1. Contract owner can set some deploy fee
2. Tweet with certain ID is loaded to the website - this case ID 1844 is assumed
3. Content creator deploys his tweet with some certain parameters - pays minor fee from his vault or inludes fee in transaction.
4. Follower mints deployed tweet with customizable image - pays fee established by content creator from his vault or inludes fee in transaction.
5. Some basic metadata about tweet and customized image is stored in IPFS via `NFT.storage` API
6. URI to this metadata is stored in the blockchain

### Deployed Contract
The contract is fully verified and visible on [Polygonscan](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x4c629d4f72fc89cc2ca1650994429bcd91c3d99c). Once tests are performed [here](#tests), you can see some results in polygonscan:
